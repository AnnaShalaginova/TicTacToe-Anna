DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
I started out by researching how tic tac toe games where done in the past with JavaScript. Some of the approaches I found were very elaborate with complicated logic. I started my own development process with a 'blank sheet of paper': typing out html and javascript code from scratch. My code for the game board itself had a lot more lines that it does now. It was fun constructing the win conditions logic and testing it. This part went through many interations. I then moved on to the API and event handling part of the game in Jquery. Getting the authentication part of the page to work was a definitely a learning experience. The next stage was ensuring the user messaging works properly, stopping the user the from clicking twice on a cell. I needed to get creative about the game always starting with an 'x' even if the previous game was interrupted before reaching a win state.
